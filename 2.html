      title="css specification">Stands for "Cascading Style Sheet." Cascading style sheets are
       used to format the layout of Web pages</a>. <br>

       They can be used to
      define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that
       previously could only be defined in a page's HTML.
      <br><br>
      CSS helps Web developers create a uniform look across several
      pages of a Web site. Instead of defining the style of each table and
      each block of text within a page's HTML, commonly used styles need
      to be defined only once in a CSS document. Once the style is defined
       in cascading style sheet, it can be used by any page that references
       the CSS file. Plus, CSS makes it easy to change styles across several
       pages at once. For example, a Web developer may want to increase
      the default text size from 10pt to 12pt for fifty pages of a Web site.
       If the pages all reference the same style sheet, the text size only needs
       to be changed on the style sheet and all the pages will show the larger text.
      <br><br>
      While CSS is great for creating text styles, it is helpful for formatting
      other aspects of Web page layout as well. For example, CSS can be used
       to define the cell padding of table cells, the style, thickness, and color
       of a table's border, and the padding around images or other objects.
      CSS gives Web developers more exact control over how Web pages
       will look than HTML does. This is why most Web pages today
       incorporate cascading style sheets.
